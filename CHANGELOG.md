0.1b : 2013-06-08

    Second release.
    Rewrote the BGP library to return a custom data structure.
      This was necessary to make the library more extensible.
      In its previous incarnation, it returned a bunch of
      `puts` statements.  Not very helpful!
    Added LICENSE and CHANGELOG.md.
    Updated the example, `bgp_health.rb`, to utilize the
      BGP library correctly.
    Updated `README.md` to include new information and indicate
      the rewrite.
